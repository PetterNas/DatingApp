This is an app I made for learning purposes. It was meant to get more familiar with .NET core and Angular.

The API is built in .NET core, and the front end uses Angular and bootstrap.
It uses Entity Framework to handle the database.

Other features this includes:

- SignalR for live updates(new message alert and logins).
- Roles management.
- Login using JWT tokens.
- Chat / like feature.
- Photo upload to Cloudinary API.
